# InterAct
An app to help managers track their interactions and address implicit bias.

## Project Details
InterAct is an iOS app to help you manager your interactions over time. The idea is that you can track if you are interacting with everyone you want to be interacting with over a certain period of time. Implict bias might prevent us from spending our time evenly and throughout an organiztion. InterAct helps you to be aware of all your interactions. You also have the option to add notes about a person or an interaction. All the data is contained locally in Core Data

## Architectiure
InterAct is written in Swift using UIKit. The Navigation is built using coordinator pattern. The architecture is MVVM via delagate and protocol. It stores everything locally in Core Data.

## Project Distribution
This project is available on the App Store.
